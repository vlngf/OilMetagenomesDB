## Dictionary for Materials Column:

**seawater** - often taken from oil spills

**production fluid** - the undivided oil production fluid that has not yet separated

**formation water** - water that is together with oil and solid phase, but which contains very little oil

**injection water** - water that is pumped in to pump out oil under pressure

**oil contaminated soil** - soil contaminated with oil

**soil** - just soil without oil, control

**crude oil** - pure oil, high percentage of hydrocarbons

**core** - a cylindrical rock sample that is extracted from a well for laboratory analysis

**reservoir fluids** - same as reservoir brine, may be what is produced but also called in an oil reservoir, a mixture of water, oil and solids, not yet stratified

**drilling mud** - is what's needed to lubricate the drill

**drilling cuttings** - cuttings that go back to the ground when drilling

**oil sands** - refers to a type of unconventional petroleum deposit that consists of a mixture of sand, water, clay, and bitumen, often refers to surface mining

**clean water** - often the control of any water

**solid** - solid phase formed after extraction

**grounded water** - underground water that has little connection to the reservoir itself

**pipeline solids** - sediment on the pipeline, usually taken to check for corrosion.
